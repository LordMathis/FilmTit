  ><em
    >FilmTit</em
    > is a web application that assists amateur subtitle translators with translating movie and TV shows subtitles. In order to help save the amount of work spent on the translation, it provides suggestions on how the subtitles could be translated, based on a database of already existing translated subtitles.</p
  ><p
  >You can translate any subtitle file you have from English to Czech or from Czech to English, making use of the millions of translations already made by other movie subtitles translators, coming from the tens of thousands of subtitle files in our database. From these, we always carefully select the most relevant ones for the lines that you are translating at the moment, which you can use as they are, post-edit them a little, or just use them for inspiration. And even if we find no similar lines in our database, there is always the machine translation system, ready to provide an automatically generated translation for any line you encounter.<sup

      ></sup
    ></p
  ><p
  >Often it may be hard to fully understand the subtitles without seeing the movie; therefore, you have the possibility to load a movie file into the application, and the part of the movie that you are translating at a given moment will always be played to you, also showing he source subtitles (and the target ones as well if you have already translated them). Most of the movie formats and codecs are supported!</p
  ><p
  >FilmTit is a web application, which means you just have to open your favourite internet browser and you can start translating straight away – no installation is necessary (although you may have to install Java and VLC for the video playback function, see Section um:sec:installations). However, this does not mean that you have to be online to translate the subtitles! Once you get all the translation suggestions from the server, you can go to the Offline Mode, work on the translation offline, and all your work will be automatically saved on the server when you are online again! See Section um:sec:offlinemode.</p
  ><p
  >Similar to Google Documents, every single user operation is saved right after it is done – there is no need for saving the documents manually; even if your browser crashes, you can continue working on the subtitle document exactly at the place where you ended last time.</p
  ><p
  >Your data are available from any computer at any time exactly in the state you left them.<sup

    > {The paragraph is more of an advertisement than truth. I would remove the whole para. We save the user translations transparently, yes. But this is the only place where this is done, everything else must be explicitely submited by the user. And even then, if he works in Offline Mode, he must then go online on the same computer in the same browser, so even then it is only half the truth.}Similarly to Google Documents, you do not have to worry about saving your work – your translations are automatically saved online right after you type them! {proposed new version of paragraph}To run the application, you need a web browser with HTML5 support (Opera v. 12 Firefox v. 14, Chrome v. 21, Safari v. 5.1.5, or higher {find versions exactly}). To use the optional video playback in your browser, you also need to have Java (at least version 1.6) and the VLC plugin (at least version 1.1.4).{add it, who knows it -- I just added my versions, for which it works...

RR}After submitting your user name and user password and confirming that the FilmTit application can receive your authentication data, the pop-up window will be automatically closed.

The user name from this registration is extracted from the email address. There is a chance that two users have a very similar email address and the extracted name will be the same.

Then you are asked to choose the source language of the subtitles, encoding of the subtitle file and the path to the actual subtitle file you would like to translate. You should also make sure you selected the proper encoding of the source subtitle file.

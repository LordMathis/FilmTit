This is a directory with scripts for database

The export file (from OpenSubtitles.org) have to be unzipped into export
folder - so all the files are in "export/files/something.gz".

Also, there has to be "export_final_sorted_and_uniq.txt" in files (I forgot
how I made it, though, sorry :/ it was some basic sorting + then some other
deletions)

[the file from opensubtitles SHOULD be on filmtit server in /filmtit/data/
right now]

----
view_movie.pl [movie ID] [lines]
will read the movie with a given ID and all his subtitles
---
view_subtitle.pl [subtitle ID]
will just unzip and print the subtitle (without any editing)

Pairing.pm is helping moduele
----
pairing_file2file.pl tries to find the best pair of files for each movie

(you can limit the number of movies by constants at the beginning)

it prints the movie id \t english_file \t czech \t distance on stdout

the result is in "vysledky", then I sorted it by distance to "vysledky_sorted"
and then I took the top 6k (by random viewing it seemed the best number, 7k is
too much - too much of misaligned stuff)

it is possible to review it later of course 
-----
pairing_text2text.pl tries to find the best pairs of chunks for a given pair
of files

it prints it on stdout, in a weird encoding (since it comes from gunzip
directly by pipe, I was not converting it and just print it as it is)
---
do_all_pairings_text2text.pl goes through all the movies and print the pairs
out to pairs_wrong_encoding/[filenumber]
---
split_lines.scala [path/to/files]
splits the lines and saves them in path/to/files_aligned (path therefor cant end with / because I am lazy)
